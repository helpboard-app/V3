## Reporting a Vulnerability

https://github.com/helpboard-app/V3/issues/15

## How the vulnerability report will be handled

As long as it is a vulnerability with at least a CVSS V3.1 Overall Score of 2 or higher. I will try to fix it as soon as I can.
Otherwise, I will still try to fix it but, it might be a while until it gets fixed. Also there is no garentee I will fix it either.
If you have a proposed solution, and I think it will solve the issue without breaking anything or causing more vulnerabilities. I will merge it.
